## Usage

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook detailing how to pull APIs from LTA DataMall and HERE Routing API. It also includes instructions on how to use Google Gemini. The goal is to implement both APIs together as a working prototype for [NUS-NCS-Hackathon-2024](https://github.com/J0JIng/NUS-NCS-Hackathon-2024).
